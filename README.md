# The Diagon Alley Site

This project is an online representation of Diagon alley, a fictional cobblestoned wizarding alley and shopping area in the Harry Potter universe. It is built using HTML5, CSS3(+ the Twitter Bootstrap 5 framework), JavaScript for front-end, and Ruby on Rails(6) along with PostgreSQl object-relational database system for the back-end. 
For production, the app is deployed using Heroku, with Cloudinary as add-on for storing pictures.
